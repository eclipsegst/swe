How to create your own branch:

For example my pawprint is zztg2, I'll use the comand line below to create a
branch.(please use your own pawprint)

git checkout -b zztg2
This will create a local(in your own laptop) branch, you might want to push
this branch to the remote repository.
You can find remote name by,
git remote
git remote -v

The remote name is,
git@codeforge.cs.missouri.edu:swe-sp14gn.git

The next step is to push you local branch to the remote repository by using,
 
git push git@codeforge.cs.missouri.edu:swe-sp14gn.git zztg2
