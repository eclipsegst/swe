How to create your own branch:

For example my pawprint is zztg2, I'll use the comand line below to create a
branch.(please use your own pawprint)

git checkout -b zztg2
This will create a local(in your own laptop) branch, you might want to push
this branch to the remote repository.
You can find remote name by,
git remote
git remote -v

The remote name is,
git@codeforge.cs.missouri.edu:swe-sp14gn.git

The next step is to push you local branch to the remote repository by using,
 
git push git@codeforge.cs.missouri.edu:swe-sp14gn.git zztg2

You have to use the remote name only once. So you can use the line below to
push your local branch to your remote branch.

git push

===========================================================================
But it will not change the remote master
respository(https://codeforge.cs.missouri.edu/p/swe-sp14gn/source/tree/master/).
If you want to change the remote master, what you need to do is,
Step 1. switch to local master by using
git checkout master

Step 2. merge your own branch with master
git merge zztg2

Step 3. push local master to remote master
git push
